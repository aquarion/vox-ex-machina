VOX EX MACHINA
==============

VeM is a Twillo-powered voicemail solution, designed because my previous voicemail solution's getting a bit awful.

Things it does now:

* Recieve and record Voicemail
* Search google contacts (multiple accounts) for who the voicemail is from
* Send you an email with an MP3 link of the voicemail
* Use Twilio's transcription service to attempt to provide a rough idea of what it is.
* Attach the MP3 to the email instead of a link

Things it will do in the future:

* Time-based voicemail messages
* Group-based voicemail messages (So friends can get a different response to coworkers)
* Send an SMS notification of recieved voicemail
* Maybe upload the message directly to gmail? Possibly?
* Greet callers we recognise by name.

Things I am not planning on making it do:

* Be a generic service. This is an "Install on your own server" thing.
